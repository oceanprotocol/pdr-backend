- If you are a **frontend dev** working on predictoor.ai: do [Frontend-Dev README](READMEs/frontend-dev.md)

## About

The `pdr-backend` repo implements all of the agents of the Predictoor ecosystem.

Each agent has a directory:
- `predictoor` - agent that submits individual predictions
- `trader` - agent that buys aggregated predictions, then trades
- `trueval` - agent that reports true values to contract
- `dfbuyer` - agent that buys aggregate predictions on behalf of Data Farming

Other directories:
- `utils` - tools for use by any agent

The `predictoor` and `trader` agents are meant to be customized by predictoor and trader stakeholders, respectively.
