Flow
  - reads from subgraph list of dt3 contracts, to get all deployed contracts
  - for every contract, monitors when epoch is changing
  - once an epoch is ended, calculate the true_val and submit.

Notes on customization:

  The actual true_val is fetched by calling function get_true_val()

  We call get_true_val() with 4 args:
   - topic: this is pair object
   - initial_timestamp:   blocktime for begining of epoch - 2
   - end_timestamp:   blocktime for begining of epoch -1

  Then it returns true_val, which gets submitted to contract

  You need to change the code to support more complex flows. Now, it's based on ccxt
