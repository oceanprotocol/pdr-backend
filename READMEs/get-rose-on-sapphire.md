- [2. Purchase ROSE](#2-purchase-rose)
- [3. Transfer ROSE from Emerald to Sapphire](#3-transfer-rose-from-emerald-to-sapphire)

## 1. Create a Wallet

For optimal support and the ability to transfer ROSE between paratimes, we recommended to use Oasis Wallet extension for Chrome.
- To install and set up, go to [Oasis Wallet extension documentation](https://docs.oasis.io/general/manage-tokens/oasis-wallets/browser-extension/#install-the-oasis-wallet-via-chrome-web-store) and follow its instructions.

## 2. Purchase ROSE

First, acquire ROSE at an exchange like Binance, Coinbase, Gate.io, or KuCoin.

Then, you'll be withdrawing ROSE to your web3 wallet.
- If the exchange supports withdrawal directly to Oasis Sapphire Paratime: great, do that directly! Then you can skip step 3. 
- It it doesn't support direct: first, send to Oasis Emerald Network. Then, follow step 3.

⚠️ Sending to the wrong address or network will likely result in the loss of your tokens. To minimize risk: send a small test amount first, and double-check the receiving address and network.

## 3. Transfer ROSE from Oasis wallet to Sapphire ParaTime

To transfer ROSE from Oasis wallet to Sapphire ParaTime, first make sure you have an Ethereum Account to be used by the EVM-compatible Sapphire ParaTime. This will probably be the account you will use to send predictions with.

To transfer the ROSE, go to the **ParaTimes** section of the Oasis Wallet, click on **To ParaTime** button from the **Sapphire** section, enter the amount you want to send and the Ethereum Account address to transfer to and send the tokens. (You can also import the Ethereum Account inside Oasis Wallet.)

For details, please refer to the official Oasis guide: [How to Transfer ROSE into a ParaTime](https://docs.oasis.io/general/manage-tokens/how-to-transfer-rose-into-paratime)

⚠️ Be sure to select “Sapphire” as the destination paratime during the transfer process. Double-check this selection to avoid transferring tokens to an unintended paratime. 

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully transferred ROSE to Sapphire Mainnet. Do manage private keys with utmost care.
