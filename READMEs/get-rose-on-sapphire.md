## 1. Create a Wallet

For optimal support and the ability to transfer ROSE between paratimes, it's recommended to use the Oasis Wallet extension for Chrome. Follow the detailed instructions provided in the official [Oasis Wallet extension documentation](https://docs.oasis.io/general/manage-tokens/oasis-wallets/browser-extension/#install-the-oasis-wallet-via-chrome-web-store) to install and setup your wallet.

## 2. Purchase ROSE

Acquire ROSE from various exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Gate.io, or KuCoin. Once obtained, ensure to withdraw the amount of ROSE you'd like to utilize to your web3 wallet. If withdrawing to the Oasis Sapphire network is supported by the centralized exchange (CEX) you're using, you can do so and skip the next two steps. However, if that's not an option, ensure you are sending the funds to the Oasis Emerald network, as sending to a different network may result in the loss of your tokens. **Always double-check the receiving address before initiating the withdrawal to secure your assets.**

## 3. Transfer ROSE from Emerald to Sapphire

To transfer your ROSE from the Emerald to the Sapphire paratime, please refer directly to the detailed guide available in the official Oasis documentation.
