# Get ROSE on Sapphire Mainnet

Steps:

1. [Create a Wallet](#1-create-a-wallet)
2. [Purchase ROSE](#2-purchase-rose)
3. [Transfer ROSE from Oasis Wallet to Sapphire](#3-transfer-rose-from-oasis-wallet-to-sapphire)

## 1. Create a Wallet

For optimal support and the ability to transfer ROSE between paratimes, we recommended to use Oasis Wallet extension for Chrome.

To install, go to [Oasis Wallet extension documentation](https://docs.oasis.io/general/manage-tokens/oasis-wallets/browser-extension/#install-the-oasis-wallet-via-chrome-web-store) and follow its instructions.

## 2. Purchase ROSE

First, acquire ROSE at an exchange like Binance, Coinbase, Gate.io, or KuCoin. For a full list, see [Coingecko Oasis page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network) -> "Markets" section.

Then, you'll be withdrawing ROSE to your web3 wallet.
- If the exchange supports withdrawal directly to Oasis Sapphire Paratime: great, do that directly! Then you can skip step 3. 
- It it doesn't support direct: first, send to Oasis Emerald Network. Then, follow step 3.

⚠️ Sending to the wrong address or network will likely result in the loss of your tokens. To minimize risk: send a small test amount first, and double-check the receiving address and network.

## 3. Transfer ROSE from Oasis wallet to Sapphire

"ParaTimes" are subnets in the Oasis chain ecosystem. Sapphire is a ParaTime. Saphire is EVM-compatible, which means that it uses EVM wallets. 

(EVM = Ethereum Virtual Machine. EVM-compatible means that it runs Ethereum-style contracts. EVM accounts = Ethereum-style accounts, including an address that starts with "0x" and support for ERC20 tokens.)

As a pre-requisite, ensure that you have an EVM account ready for use in Sapphire. Eg in the Oasis wallet extension, do an "Import Ethereum Account". Specify Sapphire ParaTime as appropriate. 

To transfer the ROSE to your (EVM) Sapphire account, using the Oasis wallet extension:
1. Go to the "ParaTimes" section
2. In the "Sapphire" section, click on "To ParaTime"
3. Enter the amount to send and the Ethereum Account address to transfer to and send the tokens.
4. Click "confirm" as needed
5. To verify that the tx happened, check balances in your Oasis walelt, or use Oasis & Sapphire block explorers

The official Oasis guide has details: [How to Transfer ROSE into a ParaTime](https://docs.oasis.io/general/manage-tokens/how-to-transfer-rose-into-paratime)

⚠️ Be sure to select “Sapphire” as the destination ParaTime during the transfer process. Double-check this selection to avoid transferring tokens to an unintended ParaTime. 

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully transferred ROSE to Sapphire Mainnet. Do manage private keys with utmost care.
