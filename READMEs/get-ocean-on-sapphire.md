# Get OCEAN on Sapphire Mainnet

OCEAN has address [`0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520`](https://explorer.oasis.io/mainnet/sapphire/token/0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520) on Sapphire.

There are two approaches to acquire it:

1. Use an OCEAN-ROSE DEX on Sapphire
2. Bridge OCEAN from Eth mainnet

(1) is much simpler. (2) isn't subject to slippage. We cover both below.

## Approach 1: OCEAN-ROSE DEX on Sapphire

How to use:

1. Go to **[Illuminex OCEAN-ROSE pool](https://illuminex.xyz/swap?inputCurrency=0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520&inputChainId=23294&outputCurrency=0x8Bc2B030b299964eEfb5e1e0b36991352E56D2D3&outputChainId=23294)**.
2. Specify amount to send, and destination address
3. Click "Swap"

Notes:

- If you see a "Insufficient liquidity" warning, then click the settings gear and toggle "Use secure router = on".
- Be careful for slippage, always. (Though there _should_ be decent liquidity. [Pool info](https://illuminex.xyz/pools/0x841dd137A2B380DA4568f6745aEAc20EDa910313))

## Approach 2: Bridge OCEAN from Eth mainnet

**This approach has three steps:**

1. [Get OCEAN on Eth Mainnet](#get-ocean-on-eth-mainnet)
1. [Transfer OCEAN to Sapphire Mainnet via Celer](#transfer-ocean-to-sapphire-mainnet-via-celer)
1. [Verify Your Tokens on Sapphire Mainnet](#verify-your-tokens-on-sapphire-mainnet)

## Get OCEAN on Eth Mainnet

**First, create a Wallet.** For optimal support and the ability to transfer ROSE between paratimes, we recommend the Oasis Wallet extension for Chrome. To proceed, [follow instructions in its docs](https://docs.oasis.io/general/manage-tokens/oasis-wallets/browser-extension/#install-the-oasis-wallet-via-chrome-web-store).

**Then, purchase OCEAN.** First, acquire OCEAN at an exchange like Binance, Coinbase, Gate.io, or KuCoin. Then, withdraw that OCEAN to your web3 wallet.

⚠️ Sending to the wrong address or network will likely result in the loss of your tokens. To minimize risk: send a small test amount first, and double-check the receiving address and network.

## Transfer OCEAN to Sapphire Mainnet via Celer

**First, Navigate to Celer bridge.** [Here](https://cbridge.celer.network/1/23294/OCEAN).

**Then, Connect Your Wallet.** Click on the "Connect Wallet" button. Follow the prompts to select and connect your web3 wallet.

**Then, Configure Transfer Settings:**

- Ensure the "From" field is set to "Ethereum Mainnet."
- Confirm "Oasis Sapphire" is selected as the destination on the "To" field.
- Input the amount of OCEAN you desire to transfer in the designated field.

**Finally, Execute the Transfer:**

- Click on the "Transfer" button.
- Review the transaction details.
- Confirm the transaction from your wallet.

## Verify Your Tokens on Sapphire Mainnet

Bridging requires several minutes to complete. Your OCEAN will be sent to the address you executed the transaction from.

To verify:

- See the tx on [Oasis Explorer](https://explorer.sapphire.oasis.io/address/0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520/transactions).
- Or, import the OCEAN token contract address `0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520` into your wallet. Set symbol = `OCEAN` and decimal precision = `18`.

Congrats! You've successfully transferred OCEAN to Sapphire Mainnet.
