# Get OCEAN on Sapphire Mainnet

There are two approaches:
1. Use a ROSE-OCEAN DEX on Sapphire
2. Bridge OCEAN from Eth mainnet

(1) is much simpler. (2) isn't subject to slippage. We cover both below.

# Approach 1: ROSE-OCEAN DEX on Sapphire

**[Lizard Exchange](https://sapphire.lizard.exchange/swap)** has an OCEAN-ROSE pool.

So, simply go to the DEX and swap ROSE for OCEAN. Be careful for slippage.

# Approach 2: Bridge OCEAN from Eth mainnet

**A2 has three steps:**

1. [Get OCEAN on Eth Mainnet](#1-get-ocean-on-eth-mainnet)
1. [Transfer OCEAN to Sapphire Mainnet via Celer](#2-transfer-ocean-to-sapphire-mainnet-via-celer)
1. [Verify Your Tokens on Sapphire Mainnet](#3-verify-your-tokens-on-sapphire-mainnet)

## A2:1 Get OCEAN on Eth Mainnet

**First, create a Wallet.** For optimal support and the ability to transfer ROSE between paratimes, we recommend the Oasis Wallet extension for Chrome. To proceed, [follow instructions in its docs](https://docs.oasis.io/general/manage-tokens/oasis-wallets/browser-extension/#install-the-oasis-wallet-via-chrome-web-store).

**Then, purchase OCEAN.** First, acquire OCEAN at an exchange like Binance, Coinbase, Gate.io, or KuCoin. Then, withdraw that OCEAN to your web3 wallet.

⚠️ Sending to the wrong address or network will likely result in the loss of your tokens. To minimize risk: send a small test amount first, and double-check the receiving address and network.

## A2:2 Transfer OCEAN to Sapphire Mainnet via Celer

**First, Navigate to Celer bridge.** [Here](https://cbridge.celer.network/1/23294/OCEAN).

**Then, Connect Your Wallet.** Click on the "Connect Wallet" button. Follow the prompts to select and connect your web3 wallet.

**Then, Configure Transfer Settings:**
- Ensure the "From" field is set to "Ethereum Mainnet."
- Confirm "Oasis Sapphire" is selected as the destination on the "To" field.
- Input the amount of OCEAN you desire to transfer in the designated field.

**Finally, Execute the Transfer:**
- Click on the "Transfer" button.
- Review the transaction details.
- Confirm the transaction from your wallet.

## A2:3 Verify Your Tokens on Sapphire Mainnet

Bridging requires several minutes to complete. Your OCEAN will be sent to the address you executed the transaction from.

To verify:
- See the tx on [Oasis Explorer](https://explorer.sapphire.oasis.io/address/0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520/transactions).
- Or, import the OCEAN token contract address `0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520` into your wallet. Set symbol = `OCEAN` and decimal precision = `18`.

Congrats! You've successfully transferred OCEAN to Sapphire Mainnet.
