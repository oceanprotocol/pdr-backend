## 1. Get OCEAN on Eth Mainnet

### 1.1 Create a Wallet

For optimal support and the ability to transfer ROSE between paratimes, we recommended to use Oasis Wallet extension for Chrome.
- To install and set up, go to [Oasis Wallet extension documentation](https://docs.oasis.io/general/manage-tokens/oasis-wallets/browser-extension/#install-the-oasis-wallet-via-chrome-web-store) and follow its instructions.

### 1.2 Purchase OCEAN

First, acquire OCEAN at an exchange like Binance, Coinbase, Gate.io, or KuCoin.

Then, you'll be withdrawing OCEAN to your web3 wallet.

⚠️ Sending to the wrong address or network will likely result in the loss of your tokens. To minimize risk: send a small test amount first, and double-check the receiving address and network.

## 2. Transfer OCEAN to Sapphire Mainnet via Celer

### 2.1 Navigate to Celer bridge

First, visit the [Celer bridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/1/23294/OCEAN).

### 2.2 Connect Your Wallet

- Follow the prompts to select and connect your web3 wallet.

### 2.3 Configure Transfer Settings

### 2.4 Execute the Transfer

- Click on the "Transfer" button.
- Review the transaction details.
- Confirm the transaction from your wallet.

## 3. Verify Your Tokens on Sapphire Mainnet

The bridging will require several minutes to complete. Your OCEAN will be sent to the address you executed the transaction from.

You can visually verify the transaction on [Oasis Explorer](https://explorer.sapphire.oasis.io/address/0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520/transactions).

Another way to visually verify the OCEAN token transfer is by importing the OCEAN token contract address `0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520` in the wallet using symbol `OCEAN` and decimal precision `18`.
