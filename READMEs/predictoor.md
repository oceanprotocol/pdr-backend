# Run a Predictoor Bot

Let's run a predictoor bot (agent), to submit predictions and earn $.

**Steps:**

Start simple, layer in complexity.

1. [Local predictoor, local network](localpredictoor-localnet.md)
2. [Local predictoor, remote network](./localbot-remotenet.md) - on testnet
3. [Remote predictoor, remote network](./remotebot-remotenet.md) - on testnet
4. Repeat (2) or (3), on mainnet. This will earn $.
5. [Claim payout](./payout.md)

## Warning

You will lose money as a predictoor if your $ out exceeds your $ in. If you have low accuracy youâ€™ll have your stake slashed a lot. Do account for gas fees, compute costs, and more. Everything you do is your responsibility, at your discretion. None of this repo is financial advice.
