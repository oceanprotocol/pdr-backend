# Run a Predictoor Bot

This README shows how to earn $ by running a predictoor bot on mainnet.

1. **[Install](#install-pdr-backend-repo)**
1. **[Simulate modeling & trading](#simulate-modeling-and-trading)**
1. **[Run bot on testnet](#run-predictoor-bot-on-sapphire-testnet)**
1. **[Run bot on mainnet](#run-predictoor-bot-on-sapphire-mainnet)**
1. **[Claim payout](#claim-payout)**
1. **[Check performance](#check-performance)**

Then, you can [go beyond](#go-beyond): [optimize model](#optimize-model), [run >1 bots](#run-many-bots-at-once), and more.


## Install pdr-backend Repo

In a new console:

```console
# clone the repo and enter into it
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend
cd pdr-backend

# Create & activate virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install modules in the environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

#add pwd to bash path
export PATH=$PATH:.
```

If you're running MacOS, then in console:
```console
codesign --force --deep --sign - venv/sapphirepy_bin/sapphirewrapper-arm64.dylib
```

## Simulate Modeling and Trading

Simulation allows us to quickly build intuition, and assess the performance of the data / predicting / trading strategy (backtest).

Copy [`ppss.yaml`](../ppss.yaml) into your own file `my_ppss.yaml` and change parameters as you see fit.

Let's simulate! In console:
```console
pdr xpmt my_ppss.yaml
```

"xpmt" is short for "experiment". (The xpmt tool is evolving beyond just simulation.)


What it does:
1. Set simulation parameters.
1. Grab historical price data from exchanges and stores in `parquet_data/` dir. It re-uses any previously saved data.
1. Run through many 5min epochs. At each epoch:
   - Build a model
   - Predict up/down
   - Trade.
   - Plot total profit versus time, and more.
   - (It logs this all to screen, and to `out*.txt`.)

The baseline settings use a linear model inputting prices of the previous 10 epochs as inputs, a simulated 0% trading fee, and a trading strategy of "buy if predict up; sell 5min later". You can play with different values in `my_ppss.yaml`.

Profit isn't guaranteed: fees, slippage and more eats into them. Model accuracy makes a big difference too.

## Run Predictoor Bot on Sapphire Testnet

Predictoor contracts run on [Oasis Sapphire](https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/sapphire/) testnet and mainnet. Sapphire is a privacy-preserving EVM-compatible L1 chain.

Let's get our bot running on testnet first.

First, tokens! You need (fake) ROSE to pay for gas, and (fake) OCEAN to stake and earn. [Get them here](testnet-faucet.md).

Then, copy & paste your private key as an envvar. In console:
```console
export PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

Update `my_ppss.yaml` as desired.

Then, run a bot with modeling-on-the fly (approach 3). In console:
```console
pdr predictoor 3 my_ppss.yaml sapphire-testnet 
```

Your bot is running, congrats! Sit back and watch it in action. It will loop continuously.

At every 5m/1h epoch, it builds & submits >1 times, to maximize accuracy without missing submission deadlines. Specifically: 60 s before predictions are due, it builds a model then submits a prediction. It repeats this until the deadline.

The CLI has a tool to track performance. Type `pdr get_predictoor_info -h` for details.

You can track behavior at finer resolution by writing more logs to the [code](../pdr_backend/predictoor/approach3/predictoor_agent3.py), or [querying Predictoor subgraph](subgraph.md).


## Run Predictoor Bot on Sapphire Mainnet

Time to make it real: let's get our bot running on Sapphire _mainnet_.

First, real tokens! Get [ROSE via this guide](get-rose-on-sapphire.md) and [OCEAN via this guide](get-ocean-on-sapphire.md).

Then, copy & paste your private key as an envvar. (You can skip this if it's same as testnet.) In console:
```console
export PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

Update `my_ppss.yaml` as desired.

Then, run the bot. In console:
```console
pdr predictoor 3 my_ppss.yaml sapphire-mainnet 
```

This is where there's real $ at stake. Good luck!

Track performance, as in testnet.

## Claim Payout

When running predictoors on mainnet, you have the potential to earn $.

**[Here](payout.md)** are instructions to claim your earnings.


# Go Beyond

You've gone through all the essential steps to earn $ by running a predictoor bot on mainnet.

The next sections describe how to go beyond, by optimizing the model and more.

## Optimize Model

Once you're familiar with the above, you can make your own model and optimize it for $. Here's how:
1. Fork `pdr-backend` repo.
1. Change predictoor approach3 modeling code as you wish, while iterating with simulation.
1. Bring your model as a Predictoor bot to testnet then mainnet.


## Run Many Bots at Once

[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) is "a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online."

This section shows first how to use PM2 to run one bot on testnet. It then shows how to extend this to mainnet, and many bots at once.

First, install PM2: `npm install pm2 -g`

Then, prepare the PM2 config file:
- Skim over [`pm2-testnet-predictoor.config.js`](../pm2-testnet-predictoor.config.js). It names the script, and sets envvars like we did above, but automatically.
- Open the local version of this file. It's in the root of your `pdr-backend/` directory. In the file, set `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`.

Now, run the bot with PM2. In console:
```console
pm2 start pm2-testnet-predictoor.config.js
```

Your bot's running on testnet again! This time with the help of PM2.

Next, monitor the logs: `pm2 logs pm2-testnet-predictoor` (ctrl-c to stop)

Finally, stop the bot: `pm2 stop pm2-testnet-predictoor`

Congrats! You've used PM2 to start, monitor, and stop a bot on testnet.

To run on _mainnet_: it's a mainnet config file [`pm2-mainnet-predictoor.config.js`](../pm2-mainnet-predictoor.config.js). It's like testnet, with different envvars. Work with the local version of this file.

To run 20 bots: alter the config file as needed. Or, have 20 config files.

Other interesting PM2 commands:
- List all running processes: `pm2 ls`
- Stop process with id=0: `pm2 stop 0 # (similar for other cmds)`
- Stop all processes: `pm2 stop all`
- Top-level help: `pm2 help`
- Help for "start" command: `pm2 help start # (similar for other cmds)`
- More yet: **[PM2 docs](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/)**

## Run Bots Remotely

To scale up compute or run without tying up your local machine, you can run bots remotely. Get started [here](remotebot.md).

## Run Local Network

To get extra-fast block iterations, you can run a local test network (with local bots). It does take a bit more up-front setup. Get started [here](barge.md).

- [Root README](../README.md)

## Warning

You will lose money as a predictoor if your $ out exceeds your $ in. If you have low accuracy youâ€™ll have your stake slashed a lot. Do account for gas fees, compute costs, and more. Everything you do is your responsibility, at your discretion. None of this repo is financial advice.
