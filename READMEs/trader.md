# Run a Trader Bot

Let's run a trader bot (agent), to consume predictions, trade and earn $.

**Steps:**

Start simple, layer in complexity.

1. [Local trader, local network](localtrader-localnet.md)
2. [Local trader, remote network](./localbot-remotenet.md) - on testnet
3. [Remote trader, remote network](./remotebot-remotenet.md) - on testnet
4. Repeat (2) or (3), on mainnet

## Warning

You will lose money trading if your $ out exceeds your $ in. Do account for trading fees, order book slippage, cost of prediction feeds, and more. Everything you do is your responsibility, at your discretion. None of this repo is financial advice.
