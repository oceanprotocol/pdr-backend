# Claim Payout for Predictoor Bot

This README describes how you can claim the $ based on running a predictoor bot.

First, congratulations on your participation and progress in making predictions! Whether you've made accurate or erroneous predictions, it's now time to claim your earnings from correct predictions.

There are two sections below: to claim OCEAN payout, and ROSE payout, respectively.

## Steps to Request OCEAN Rewards

### 1. Preparation

Ensure you pause or stop any ongoing prediction submissions. You can use `Ctrl-C` to stop the predictions. This is crucial as active submissions can interfere with the payout process.

### 2. Execute Payout

From console:

```console
pdr claim_OCEAN ppss.yaml
```

### 3. Completion

Once the payout module concludes its operation, your balance will reflect the updated amount.
